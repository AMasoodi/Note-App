# Note-App
Challenge11
This is a Note-Taker application that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. After testing this application locally, it was deployed using Heroku. When the user visits the initial page, you will see a 'get started' button that will then direct you to the 'Notes" page. Here the user is able to create, delete, and update notes.
